**Intro to GitHub**

* **GitHub: A Cloud-Based Collaboration Platform** GitHub is a web-based platform that allows for version control and collaboration on code projects. It builds upon the power of Git, a powerful version control tool. 
* **Version Control (Simplified):**  Think of version control like a sophisticated "save" system for your code. It lets you track changes, revert to previous versions, and work in parallel branches without overwriting each other's work.
* **Why Use GitHub?**
    *   **Store and Share Code:** Securely host your projects and share them with the world.
    *   **Collaborate:** Work effectively with teams, both small and large.
    *   **Open-Source Community:** Participate in and contribute to thousands of open-source projects. 

**Setting Up a GitHub Account**

**Git & GitHub: A Quick Cheat Sheet**

**Basic Git Commands**

*   `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder.
*   `git add .`: Stage all changes for a commit.
*   `git commit -m "Your commit message"`: Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
*   `git push origin main`: Push changes to your remote GitHub repository ('main' branch).
*   `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`: Clone an existing repository. 

**GitHub Workflow**

*   **Create a Repository:** On GitHub, start a new repository for your project.
*   **Connect Locally:** Link your local project to the GitHub repository using `git remote add`.
*   **Commit and Push:**  Work on your project, commit changes frequently, and push them to GitHub.
*   **Collaborate (Optional):** If collaborating, use branches, pull requests, and issues for streamlined teamwork.
