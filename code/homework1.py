# some useful functions

# input()  # takes input from the user
# print()  # prints to the console
# type()  # returns the type of a variable

# and remember the variable types we learned about:

# - int: for integer numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# - float: for decimal numbers, like 1.5, 2.3, 3.0
# - str: for strings, like "hello", "world", "this is a string"

# remember that to use a function you implemented you need to call it like this:

# calculate_total_price(price=10.5, quantity=5)
# or
# some_price = 10.5
# some_quantity = 5
# calculate_total_price(price=some_price, quantity=some_quantity)
